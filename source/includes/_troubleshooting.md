# Troubleshooting & Support

Hopefully your experience with the VIEW is smooth and issue-free, but should there be a problem, don't worry -- we're here to help!  Reporting issues helps to improve the product for everyone, so there are some systems in place to help with this.

### Questions on the best settings to use?
Check out the facebook group to learn from other users and share ideas: <https://www.facebook.com/groups/395686464095972/>

### Need help not covered here?
Send me a message through the contact page here and I'll get in touch ASAP: <http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/>

Make sure to include the firmware version on the VIEW (seen on the top bar before a camera is connected) as well as the camera model.

### Sending time-lapse log files to support
If a problem occurs during a time-lapse, sending the error log will help in quickly identifying and solving the core cause.  Here are the steps to take (firmware v1.5.0 or newer is required for this):

- From the main menu, go to Time-lapse Clips
- Select the problematic clip
- Press the menu/context button (lower right)
- Select "Send log for review", then select the general reason

It will then upload the report next time it's connected via view.tl.

If you send a report, let me know more details by sending a message here: <http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/>

<aside class="notice">NOTE: In order for log files to upload, the VIEW device must be setup for the remote app (paired with your account on app.view.tl). If you haven't already done this, please see <a href="#remote-internet-method">the remote app setup page</a>.  Once it's paired, any queued logs will be uploaded automatically.</aside>

### Trouble with a particular camera
First, try a different USB cable if possible -- Sony cameras seem to be especially picky.

If a particular camera is not working, it might not be fully supported.  You can help provide the info needed for adding support by doing the following (firmware v1.5.0 or newer is required for this):

- Connect the camera to the VIEW
- Go to Settings, then select "Send camera report"

It will then take an image, gather information about the camera, and upload it via view.tl next time you're connected.  The image will not be sent -- only the associated data and error log.

If you send a report, let me know more details by sending a message here: <http://www.timelapseplus.com/contact/>

### Trouble Connecting to Wifi
Currently, it does not connect to Apple brand wifi routers.  This is being researched and will hopefully be resolved soon.  Other users have reported that creating a guest network on the Apple router works for connecting the VIEW.

Also, if it fails to connect, try disabling wifi, enabling it again, then reconnecting making sure the password is correct (it's case-sensitive).

Also, if firmware updates fail to download, make sure Bluetooth is disabled in Settings->Wireless Setup, as this can sometimes cause issues.
